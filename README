To get CMScout3 to work do the following:
*Create a database
*Import the cmscout3.sql file into the database
*create app/config/database.php and insert the following (Changing where necessary):
	<?php
		class DATABASE_CONFIG {

			var $default = array(
				'driver' => 'mysql',
				'persistent' => false,
				'host' => 'localhost',
