You need the following in order to use CMScout3:
*Apache with mod_rewrite running and .htaccess files should be allowed.
*PHP > version 5

Currently CMScout 3 has only been tested with:
*Apache v2.2.11
*PHP v5.2.8 and v5.2.9-2
*MySQL 5.1.30 and 5.1.33

To get CMScout3 to work do the following:
*Create a database
*Import the cmscout3.sql file into the database
*open app/config/database.php and set the values correctly.
